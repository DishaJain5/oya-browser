        These terms are an agreement between you and {COMPANY} (&quot;Oya&quot;, &quot;we&quot;) for Oya Browser, Oya
        Cloud at oyabrowser.com, the SDK, CLI and APIs (the &quot;Service&quot;). If you use the Service for a company,
        you accept them for that company and confirm you may. A signed order form or enterprise agreement takes
        precedence over these terms where they differ.

        Give accurate details, keep your sign-in and API keys secret, and tell us at {mail} if you think someone else
        has used them. You are responsible for what happens under your account and your keys, including what agents and

          Oya acts in websites on your instructions, with your sessions. You are responsible for those instructions and
          their results. Do not use the Service to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>break the law, or the terms of a site in a way that exposes others to harm;</li>
          <li>access accounts, systems or data you are not authorised to use;</li>
          <li>send spam, run fraud, impersonate others, or harvest personal data without a lawful basis;</li>
          <li>attack, overload or probe the Service or any site, or get around our usage limits;</li>
          <li>
            build or train a competing product from the Service&apos;s output or code outside its open-source licence.

        Agents use AI models and can make mistakes: click the wrong thing, misread a page, or report something untrue.
        Review what matters before you rely on it, and keep a person in the loop for actions that cannot be undone, such
        as payments or sending messages. Third-party model providers you connect apply their own terms.

        runs to the end of the period already paid, and fees are not refunded except where the law requires. We may
        change prices with at least 30 days&apos; notice, starting from your next period. Taxes are yours.
